        <p class="fs-3">
            This project presents a cartographic narrative of some of the major events in the Revolt of 1857 in India. The Revolt began as a mutiny in the Bengal army of the East India Company in the northern part of the country. It immediately spread to different parts of British India and various classes, thus acquiring the nature of a popular uprising against foreign rule. The Revolt of 1857 was the largest and the most serious threat the East India Company had to face in the subcontinent.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-3">
            The scale of the revolt, the complexity of the events, and the nature of Imperial documentation present some difficulties in layering out the events temporally and spatially, especially in understanding the native mobilization and tactics. Due to these constraints, the scope of the project is limited to the major events that took place between May 1857 and March 1858 in the cities of Meerut, Delhi, and Lucknow, which were central to the overall trajectory and outcome of the uprising.
        </p>
        <p class="fs-3">
            Notwithstanding the limitations, this cartographic representation aims to help students, teachers, and history enthusiasts gain a virtual and cartographic understanding of the Revolt of 1857.
